### Overview

The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between demographic information, and the different kinds of food sources in Chicago.
With tract level American Community Survey Data from the Census, and food inspection data from the City of Chicago, we created a dashboard that allows us to visualize these layers of data simultaneously. We also did some additional levels of analysis.

      enter the following command: `python app.py --data`
   2. To launch interactive visualizations enter the the following command: `python app.py --viz`. This should print out a ocalhost address. Navigate to the address in your browser.
